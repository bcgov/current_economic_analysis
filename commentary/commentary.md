Markdown tutorial:  Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**. Itemized lists look
like:

-   this one
-   that one
-   the other one
   

Note that --- not considering the dash --- the actual text content
starts at 4-columns in (2 tabs on my machine, not sure about Windows.)
